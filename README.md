# Securing SaaS Applications Built On Serverless Microservices
![N|Solid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Amazon_Web_Services_Logo.svg =100x)
In this DevLab, you'll crack open the IDE to secure a SaaS platform built on a ReactJS web app and NodeJS serverless microservices. The app uses Amazon API Gateway and Amazon Cognito to simplify the operation and security of the service's API and identity functionality. You'll enforce user isolation and data partitioning with OAuth's JWT tokens. You'll also abstract the security complexity from developers to keep operational burden to a minimum, maximizing developer productivity, and maintaining a great developer experience.

# Lab 0: Check the app out
* Play with the app (labx.docaas.net) by:
** Using an incognito Chrome browser, and login with username: bronze1 password: Permanent1!
** Using an incognito Firefox browser, and login with username: silver1 password: Permanent1!
** Using an incognito Edge browser, and login with username: silver1 password: Permanent1!

* Check out the reactjs app
Open VS Code + 

* Check out SAM template

* Check out CloudFormation resources using the AWS Console.

# Lab 1: Access Control for SaaS plans


# Lab 3: Data Partitioning and Abstracting Security Complexity from Devs


-------------------------

# PLAN: setup
No Authorizer.
Deck access helper just writes based on identity-id with Lambda Role.
DynamoDB (multiple customer structure) Deck writing takes identity ID & Lambda Role.
Every user access to them all.

# Demo1: Multi-tenant plans + Access Control
Plan attribute.
Author Lambda Authoriser.
Change APIGW to Lambda Authoriser.
Deck access helper STILL just writes based on identity-id with Lambda Role.
Test access.

# Demo 2: Data Partitioning + Abstracting Dev Complexity.
Notice that Deck access helper STILL just writes based on identity-id with Lambda Role.
Show Data Partitioning issueâ€¦ Dev mistake. User A modifies User B.
Modify Lambda Authorizer to return or use Context.
New Policy for Cognito.
Modify Deck-Data Helper to use this!
